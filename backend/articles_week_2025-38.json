Pipeline parallelism (PP) is proposed as a solution, but its effectiveness depends on the granularity of partitioning, which can lead to trade-offs between memory consumption and hardware utilization.\n\nTo address these issues, the authors propose Elastic Pipeline Parallelism (EPP), which adaptively selects PP granularity based on resource and workload characteristics. EPP also takes into account the sequence length distribution of real-world datasets, which exhibits skewness, posing a challenge for traditional static scheduling methods.\n\nHere are the key points in JSON format:\n{\n\"summary\": \"The article discusses the challenges of long context training for Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes Elastic Pipeline Parallelism (EPP) as a solution.\",\n\"key_points\": [\n\"Pipelining parallelism is proposed to reduce communication overhead\",\n\"Elastic Pipeline Parallelism (EPP) adaptively selects granularity based on resource and workload characteristics\",\n\"Traditional static scheduling methods overlook sequence length variance, leading to suboptimal performance\"\n]\n}",
